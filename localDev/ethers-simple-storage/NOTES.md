## Switching Blockchains

Alchemy is RPC provider

- lets us connect to any blockchain that they support
- once create free acc on it, get RPC_URL and private key for any blockchain you'd like and slap those in your `.env` to deploy to that blockchain

## TS vs JS

- `import` rather than `require`

## Hardhat

popular smart contract dev framework which enables you to easily

- write tests
- enable cross-chain apps (2+ blockchains)
- save where contract deployed

- js-based dev

## Misc

- "EVM network" = solidity works on it
